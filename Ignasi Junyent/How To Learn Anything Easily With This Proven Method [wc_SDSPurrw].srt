1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:02,187
I want to share with
you what to me is the

2
00:00:02,212 --> 00:00:05,000
most effective method
of learning any skill

3
00:00:05,001 --> 00:00:07,000
and how using it has changed my life.

4
00:00:07,001 --> 00:00:08,981
But first, we need to go back to 2013.

5
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:14,000
At that time, I was about to
finish my bachelor's in biology,

6
00:00:14,001 --> 00:00:17,440
and one thing that I already knew
back then is that I didn't want to spend

7
00:00:17,465 --> 00:00:18,291
the rest of my career

8
00:00:18,316 --> 00:00:21,501
working in a lab. Therefore, I started
looking for masters that would allow

9
00:00:21,526 --> 00:00:22,125
me to do a career shift.

10
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,976
So I started checking for engineering
programs, and I ended up in the

11
00:00:25,001 --> 00:00:26,000
website of this program

12
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:29,722
that looked perfect to me, except
for one thing, and is that they required

13
00:00:29,747 --> 00:00:30,475
coding skills,

14
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,000
which I completely lacked at the
moment, and actually they wanted to test

15
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:34,001
those coding skills

16
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:37,000
before accepting you into the master.
So of course, at that moment, given I

17
00:00:37,001 --> 00:00:38,000
had zero knowledge

18
00:00:38,001 --> 00:00:43,778
in coding, I decided to apply for it?
Yes, I applied for it. In that moment,

19
00:00:43,803 --> 00:00:44,269
something changed.

20
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:47,000
It was like a switch had been flipped
in my brain, and it's something that I

21
00:00:47,001 --> 00:00:48,000
continued to experience

22
00:00:48,001 --> 00:00:51,000
many times as I grew older, and
led me to believe that I was capable of

23
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:52,001
learning anything.

24
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,000
This thing that happened to me, I
call it pressurized passion. Basically,

25
00:00:55,001 --> 00:00:58,813
As soon as I applied for that program,
my brain became like a sponge, and it

26
00:00:58,844 --> 00:00:59,491
started absorbing

27
00:00:59,516 --> 00:01:02,652
everything related to coding. I was
following every single online course I

28
00:01:02,677 --> 00:01:03,759
could find about coding

29
00:01:03,784 --> 00:01:07,000
from Stanford and MIT, and I was
going through all the lessons, taking notes,

30
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:08,000
and doing every

31
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:11,000
single exercise I could find in their
curriculum. Basically, I was spending

32
00:01:11,001 --> 00:01:12,001
every day and night

33
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:15,000
thinking about coding, and my brain
somehow started learning faster than

34
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:16,000
ever done before.

35
00:01:16,001 --> 00:01:19,000
I was seeing very quick progress,
which kept me motivated to keep learning

36
00:01:19,001 --> 00:01:20,001
and keep taking

37
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,000
courses, and after two months of
being in this pressurized passion mode,

38
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:25,000
I took the test, which I passed,

39
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:29,000
and I entered the master's I wanted.
There's a problem with this method,

40
00:01:29,001 --> 00:01:30,865
is that you need
two things to make it

41
00:01:30,877 --> 00:01:33,000
work. One of them is
some sort of pressure,

42
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:37,000
and the other thing is passion to feel it.
And the problem is that as time

43
00:01:37,001 --> 00:01:38,000
goes by, one or the other

44
00:01:38,001 --> 00:01:42,000
tend to get lower, and eventually it
reaches a point where basically, that

45
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:43,000
topic, at some point,

46
00:01:43,001 --> 00:01:46,000
you find like the most interesting
topic on the planet, and you could absorb

47
00:01:46,001 --> 00:01:48,000
anything related to it,

48
00:01:48,001 --> 00:01:51,000
All of a sudden you find it boring,
and you just couldn't care less about it,

49
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:52,001
and this is also what
happened to me.

50
00:01:52,026 --> 00:01:54,529
Now, if you want to solve
this problem, you need to

51
00:01:54,554 --> 00:01:55,000
understand how to boost

52
00:01:55,001 --> 00:01:58,000
both of those elements. The first
one is the passion. If you want to do

53
00:01:58,001 --> 00:01:59,000
something, you first need

54
00:01:59,001 --> 00:02:03,000
to have some sort of interest in it,
and the best way to create that passion

55
00:02:03,001 --> 00:02:04,000
is by starting with

56
00:02:04,001 --> 00:02:07,000
why. You should ask yourself, "Why
do I want to learn that skill? What do I

57
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,000
want to take out of it?"

58
00:02:08,001 --> 00:02:11,000
And basically, as time goes by, you
need to keep on reminding yourself of

59
00:02:11,001 --> 00:02:12,000
the answers of those

60
00:02:12,001 --> 00:02:15,000
questions to keep that passion and
motivation alive. The second element is

61
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,000
the pressure. You need to

62
00:02:16,001 --> 00:02:20,000
somehow feel the need of delivering
on something to someone, and the trick

63
00:02:20,001 --> 00:02:22,000
here is that that need should

64
00:02:22,001 --> 00:02:26,000
be enough, that if you don't deliver
need, you kind of feel bad about it,

65
00:02:26,001 --> 00:02:27,000
but at the same time,

66
00:02:27,001 --> 00:02:30,000
you don't want that need to be too
high, because if so, the pressure will be

67
00:02:30,001 --> 00:02:31,000
so high that basically,

68
00:02:31,001 --> 00:02:34,956
it will be compromising, and also
you will not move forward. So, the trick

69
00:02:34,981 --> 00:02:36,000
here is to find the right

70
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:39,000
balance between having a bit of
pressure, but just not too much. So, let me

71
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:41,000
give you another example here.

72
00:02:41,001 --> 00:02:44,000
This case, we're in 2016. I already
graduated from my masters, and I was

73
00:02:44,001 --> 00:02:45,000
already working on my

74
00:02:45,001 --> 00:02:48,041
first engineering job. And at this
point, I'm still passionate about coding,

75
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,000
but to be honest, I don't

76
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,000
have the energy anymore to go through
all those tutorials, like I used to do

77
00:02:52,001 --> 00:02:53,000
three years before.

78
00:02:53,001 --> 00:02:56,000
Now, one day, in the project I was
working on, we're looking at one of the

79
00:02:56,001 --> 00:02:57,000
measurement tools,

80
00:02:57,001 --> 00:03:00,045
and we're thinking, "How could we
automate one of the steps of that tool by

81
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,334
using image processing?"

82
00:03:01,359 --> 00:03:05,000
Now, usually, we just go to the
coding expert of our team and ask him to

83
00:03:05,001 --> 00:03:06,000
create an algorithm to automate

84
00:03:06,001 --> 00:03:09,000
that step. In this case, he was out
of office for the coming two weeks, so

85
00:03:09,001 --> 00:03:10,000
actually, we could not really do that.

86
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:13,000
In that moment, I decided I wanted
to try to impress my colleagues, and I

87
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,000
told them that probably I could

88
00:03:15,001 --> 00:03:17,000
do it, and actually, we didn't really
have to wait two weeks to probably

89
00:03:17,001 --> 00:03:18,076
code it in a couple of days.

90
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,000
And all of a sudden, I felt that
pressure are delivering to my colleagues,

91
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:22,000
because I told them I could

92
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:25,000
probably do it. Plus, I had some
intrinsic motivation in learning about

93
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:26,001
image processing. So,

94
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:30,000
altogether, I entered into a specialized
passion mode, and there you go. I

95
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,000
was spending every

96
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:34,000
single evening going through image
processing tutorials and trying to learn

97
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:35,000
as much as possible to be

98
00:03:35,001 --> 00:03:38,000
able to create that algorithm for my
project. Now, the important point here

99
00:03:38,001 --> 00:03:40,000
is that I had a safety net,

100
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,126
because if I would not have been able
to deliver, anyway, my colleague would

101
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,000
have come back from

102
00:03:44,001 --> 00:03:47,000
holidays two weeks later, and he would
have managed to create a algorithm,

103
00:03:47,001 --> 00:03:48,000
no problem. So, in a way,

104
00:03:48,001 --> 00:03:51,000
the pressure was not that high, but
because I still wanted to impress my

105
00:03:51,001 --> 00:03:52,000
colleagues, there was enough

106
00:03:52,001 --> 00:03:55,777
pressure to push me into learning
mode and bring my skills one level up.

107
00:03:57,001 --> 00:03:58,000
The good thing of this method

108
00:03:58,001 --> 00:04:01,000
is that anybody can implement it.
Let's say that, for example, you want to

109
00:04:01,001 --> 00:04:03,000
learn how to play the guitar.

110
00:04:03,001 --> 00:04:06,000
Instead of just saying to yourself, I
want to learn how to play the guitar.

111
00:04:06,001 --> 00:04:07,000
You can invite some

112
00:04:07,001 --> 00:04:09,000
friends over for dinner and tell
them that also, you're going to play a

113
00:04:09,001 --> 00:04:11,000
couple of songs in the guitar.

114
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:14,000
So, all of a sudden, the stakes are higher,
you feel that pressure, and you can enter

115
00:04:14,001 --> 00:04:14,000
can enter into the

116
00:04:14,001 --> 00:04:17,000
pressurized passion mode. And if you
want to keep the momentum going, you

117
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,000
can just keep on raising

118
00:04:18,001 --> 00:04:21,000
the stakes little by little, so the
pressure is still high enough to push

119
00:04:21,001 --> 00:04:22,081
you into the learning mode.

120
00:04:22,225 --> 00:04:26,000
Over time, I kept on using this method
to improve my skills over and over,

121
00:04:26,001 --> 00:04:27,000
and it brought me to a

122
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:30,026
point where I became fundamental for
my project team, because essentially, I

123
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,000
became the image processing guy,

124
00:04:31,001 --> 00:04:35,000
and the algorithms I was developing,
they were being used to set actual

125
00:04:35,001 --> 00:04:36,001
requirements for the

126
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,000
product that we're working on.
Now here, the stakes were real. They were

127
00:04:39,001 --> 00:04:41,000
feeling very high, because basically,

128
00:04:41,001 --> 00:04:44,000
like I mentioned, my algorithms were
being used to set requirements for the

129
00:04:44,001 --> 00:04:45,000
product, meaning,

130
00:04:45,001 --> 00:04:48,000
if I would do something wrong in
them, most likely the project would fail.

131
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,000
But that continuous

132
00:04:49,001 --> 00:04:53,000
process of using pressure-ized
passion to bring my skills one level up, it

133
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,000
brought me to a point

134
00:04:54,001 --> 00:04:57,000
where the pressure was really manageable,
and actually, there was not really

135
00:04:57,001 --> 00:04:58,001
a task that felt

136
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:02,000
really difficult to do for me.
Thanks to using this method. In 2019, I was

137
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:03,000
able to land a job within

138
00:05:03,001 --> 00:05:07,000
the same company, leading a small
team of data analysts of a product we're

139
00:05:07,001 --> 00:05:08,000
working on. And this

140
00:05:08,001 --> 00:05:10,106
all happened, because
once, I'd dare to click

141
00:05:10,118 --> 00:05:12,000
on the reply button,
and it created some

142
00:05:12,001 --> 00:05:15,000
pressure-ized passion that basically,
it brought me from having zero coding

143
00:05:15,001 --> 00:05:16,000
skills to being able

144
00:05:16,001 --> 00:05:20,000
to create some very sophisticated
algorithm. So, if you're struggling to

145
00:05:20,001 --> 00:05:21,001
learn a new skill, try

146
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,000
entering the pressure-ized passion mode.
Find a way to raise the stakes and

147
00:05:25,001 --> 00:05:26,041
hold yourself accountable.

148
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,000
Click the reply button, tell your
friends you'll show them what you've

149
00:05:28,001 --> 00:05:29,001
learned, or even

150
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,000
start your own YouTube channel,
so you can share your progress with

151
00:05:32,001 --> 00:05:33,000
everybody around the world.

152
00:05:33,001 --> 00:05:36,000
I hope my story has inspired you to
take that very first step, and if you do

153
00:05:36,001 --> 00:05:37,000
so, please let

154
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:40,000
me know in the comments below,
because I would love to read those stories.

155
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:41,000
Also, please don't forget

00:05:41,001 --> 00:05:43,157
to leave a like and
subscribe to the channel,

157
