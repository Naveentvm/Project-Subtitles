1
00:00:00,026 --> 00:00:04,553
Without a doubt, the single most
important factor to your success as a

2
00:00:04,578 --> 00:00:07,000
freelancer is your confidence.

3
00:00:07,001 --> 00:00:11,000
But unfortunately, confidence
is not the most exciting topic.

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,000
But before you click off this video,
I'm going to give you three very

5
00:00:14,001 --> 00:00:16,000
practical and actionable tips

6
00:00:16,001 --> 00:00:21,000
that you can follow to skyrocket
your confidence starting today.

7
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:24,000
Now, these things that I'm going to
share with you are very special to me

8
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:27,000
because this is what has made
the biggest difference for me

9
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:30,000
in my six-year career as a freelancer.

10
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,251
And I know they're going to make
a massive difference for you as well.

11
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,000
Now, your confidence can
be felt by everyone around you.

12
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:40,000
Your prospects, your clients,
your team members and employees.

13
00:00:40,001 --> 00:00:41,963
And so as you increase
your confidence,

14
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:44,000
everything is going
to go more smoothly.

15
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,000
You're going to get paid more.
People are going to respect you more.

16
00:00:47,425 --> 00:00:51,473
And overall, you are going to
become a more successful freelancer.

17
00:00:51,498 --> 00:00:55,000
So I want to start with an
example of how confidence works.

18
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:59,000
And the best example is
the public schooling system.

19
00:00:59,001 --> 00:01:00,000
I went to public school.

20
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:03,000
I went to elementary school,
junior high school or middle school.

21
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:06,000
And some people call high school college.

22
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:11,000
And the interesting thing about school
is whatever level we are at, we are

23
00:01:11,001 --> 00:01:15,000
overwhelmed and
intimidated by our environment.

24
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:21,000
So on elementary school, I was
nervous about my teachers and friends and

25
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:23,703
bullies and girls
and all these things

26
00:01:23,715 --> 00:01:27,000
intimidated me and they
drained my confidence.

27
00:01:27,001 --> 00:01:30,000
But then I moved on to junior
high and the same thing happened.

28
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:34,000
But when I thought about maybe going
back to elementary school, it seemed

29
00:01:34,001 --> 00:01:35,000
not so scary.

30
00:01:35,001 --> 00:01:37,489
And so if we could
have the confidence of

31
00:01:37,501 --> 00:01:40,000
our future self in
our current situation,

32
00:01:40,001 --> 00:01:43,000
we would have unlimited confidence, right?

33
00:01:43,001 --> 00:01:47,000
If I could have the confidence I had
in college in high school, I would be

34
00:01:47,001 --> 00:01:49,000
the most confident person in the school.

35
00:01:49,001 --> 00:01:54,000
And so we let our environment
and our external factors dictate our

36
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,000
confidence.

37
00:01:55,075 --> 00:01:59,000
And so we need to keep the mindset
of how can I have the confidence of my

38
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:03,000
future self five years down the
road or 10 years down the road.

39
00:02:03,001 --> 00:02:07,000
And how can I apply that
confidence to my situation today?

40
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:11,000
Now, if we boil it down to its most
simple form, truly confidence is

41
00:02:11,001 --> 00:02:13,000
determined by control.

42
00:02:13,001 --> 00:02:18,000
So the more control we have of a
situation, the more confident we feel.

43
00:02:18,001 --> 00:02:22,000
So there's a reason that we feel
more confident around our friends and in

44
00:02:22,001 --> 00:02:23,000
our own home.

45
00:02:23,001 --> 00:02:24,989
But when we go out
and we're meeting new

46
00:02:25,001 --> 00:02:27,000
people or we're in
different situations,

47
00:02:27,175 --> 00:02:31,000
it drains our confidence because we
don't have control over the environment.

48
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:35,563
Now, in terms of freelancing, there
are really only three ways where our

49
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:38,710
clients take that
control away from us.

50
00:02:38,735 --> 00:02:40,965
So if we can understand
and pinpoint these

51
00:02:40,977 --> 00:02:43,000
situations and then
take that control back,

52
00:02:43,001 --> 00:02:45,577
we're going to have
unlimited confidence and

53
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:48,000
you're going to be
blown away by how much

54
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:52,600
easier it is to land clients, charge
more and feel comfortable in every

55
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,000
single call in situation.

56
00:02:54,001 --> 00:02:57,736
So the first way that clients will
take away your control and your

57
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:01,000
confidence is through finances or money.

58
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:06,000
Or in other words, if you need their
money so badly that you're desperate,

59
00:03:06,001 --> 00:03:11,000
they have the control and you will be
nervous and anxious and needy and

60
00:03:11,001 --> 00:03:15,000
you'll worry about every word you
say and how they perceived you.

61
00:03:15,001 --> 00:03:18,828
And if you're going to close the deal
and when they take this control and

62
00:03:18,853 --> 00:03:20,610
confidence away from
you, you are much less

63
00:03:20,622 --> 00:03:23,000
likely to close deals
and land clients.

64
00:03:23,001 --> 00:03:25,000
So you need to get this control back.

65
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:30,000
The first way you can do this is just
tell yourself that you don't care and

66
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:32,000
that you don't need this client.

67
00:03:32,001 --> 00:03:36,000
Just saying that out loud is going to
get a lot of that control back to you.

68
00:03:36,001 --> 00:03:40,000
The other way you can do this
is just by landing more clients.

69
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:43,000
Now, this sounds easy and I know
that it's not as easy as it sounds.

70
00:03:43,325 --> 00:03:46,000
But the more clients you land,
the less depending you are on every

71
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:48,000
individual client and their paycheck.

72
00:03:48,001 --> 00:03:52,000
When somebody else controls your
paycheck, you don't have the control.

73
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:56,000
The second way that clients will
rob you of control and confidence is

74
00:03:56,025 --> 00:03:57,000
verbally.

75
00:03:57,001 --> 00:03:58,989
Or in other words,
the way that they talk

76
00:03:59,001 --> 00:04:01,000
to you and the way
that you talk to them.

77
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:05,000
In every conversation, there's somebody
that controls the conversation and

78
00:04:05,075 --> 00:04:06,075
controls the frame.

79
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:11,000
And if that's not you, it is going
to completely zap your confidence.

80
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:15,000
When clients pressure us, they
talk over us, they manipulate us.

81
00:04:15,001 --> 00:04:18,000
These are the ways that they are
trying to pull that control back from us.

82
00:04:18,001 --> 00:04:21,001
And oftentimes they don't even realize
they're doing it, but you have to be

83
00:04:21,075 --> 00:04:24,000
conscious of this and make
sure that you maintain that control.

84
00:04:24,001 --> 00:04:28,000
Now, the way that you can do this is
by adjusting the way that you speak.

85
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:34,000
So for example, if a client asks
you point blank, why should I hire you

86
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:37,000
rather than you trying to explain yourself,

87
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:40,000
you should respond by saying,
I'm not really sure if you should yet.

88
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm still trying to determine if
you're a good fit for us as well.

89
00:04:44,001 --> 00:04:47,801
So let's talk a little bit more about
what you need and then we'll see if

90
00:04:47,826 --> 00:04:49,000
we're a good fit.

91
00:04:49,001 --> 00:04:50,916
So you can see by
changing that wording,

92
00:04:50,928 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm not allowing them
to have that control.

93
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,000
And therefore, I am maintaining
my confidence in this conversation.

94
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:02,000
The other ways that you can
maintain this control is by talking slowly.

95
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:06,000
The faster you talk, the less confident
you seem and you'll be blown away by

96
00:05:06,001 --> 00:05:10,000
how confident you feel if you
just slow down your speaking.

97
00:05:10,225 --> 00:05:14,000
This is going to command more attention
from your prospects and it's going

98
00:05:14,001 --> 00:05:16,000
to allow you more time to know what to say.

99
00:05:16,075 --> 00:05:20,000
And when you know what you're going
to say, you also feel more confident.

100
00:05:20,001 --> 00:05:24,000
The other thing that you can do is
ask more questions in most scenarios,

101
00:05:24,225 --> 00:05:28,000
whether it is with a teacher,
whether it's with an employer,

102
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:32,000
the person that's asking the
questions is typically in charge.

103
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:35,000
And so don't allow them to
just drill you with questions.

104
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:40,000
You need to regain that frame
and start asking them questions.

105
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:41,937
And sometimes you
even need to respond

106
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:44,000
to their question
with another question.

107
00:05:44,001 --> 00:05:48,000
By controlling the conversation with
questions, you can maintain that frame.

108
00:05:48,001 --> 00:05:52,000
Now the third and final way that
clients and prospects can take away your

109
00:05:52,001 --> 00:05:56,000
control and your confidence
is through perception.

110
00:05:56,001 --> 00:05:58,000
Now this is something that I learned
from my business coach that has

111
00:05:58,001 --> 00:06:00,196
completely changed
my life because

112
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:03,000
this goes beyond just
freelancing or work.

113
00:06:03,001 --> 00:06:07,000
When you allow other people's perception
to control your own confidence, you

114
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:11,603
will lose every single time because
no matter what you do, no matter how

115
00:06:11,628 --> 00:06:16,000
fantastic you are or popular you
are or famous you are, you can never

116
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:18,000
control the perception of somebody else.

117
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,000
And so if you base your confidence
off of how other people feel about you,

118
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,000
you will never have control and
you will never have confidence.

119
00:06:25,001 --> 00:06:30,000
So instead you have to look to your
own perception of yourself and make that

120
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:33,000
the only thing that matters.

121
00:06:33,001 --> 00:06:36,000
So when you're in a call with a
prospect, stop worrying about how they're

122
00:06:36,001 --> 00:06:38,000
going to perceive you and
what they think about you.

123
00:06:38,001 --> 00:06:42,000
And if they think you sound professional
or if they think you sound like you

124
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:46,000
don't know what you're saying, you
need to let all of those things go and

125
00:06:46,001 --> 00:06:48,000
only worry about how
you feel about yourself.

126
00:06:48,001 --> 00:06:53,000
Do you feel like you're being professional
and honest and are you proud of

127
00:06:53,001 --> 00:06:57,000
the way that you're acting and if so,
you can pull a ton of confidence from

128
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,000
that.

129
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:01,060
And the nice part is
you have 100% complete

130
00:07:01,072 --> 00:07:04,000
control over how you
feel about yourself.

131
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,000
You can't control what other people
think and feel about you, but you can

132
00:07:07,001 --> 00:07:10,000
always control how you feel within.

133
00:07:10,001 --> 00:07:11,000
So remember these three things.

134
00:07:11,001 --> 00:07:15,000
You've got financial control, you've
got verbal control and you've got

135
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:17,000
perception control.

136
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:18,891
If you can control
these three aspects,

137
00:07:18,903 --> 00:07:21,000
you are going to have
unlimited confidence.

138
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,000
You're going to know exactly what to
say and people are going to be really

139
00:07:24,001 --> 00:07:26,360
impressed with the
type of person and

140
00:07:26,372 --> 00:07:29,000
