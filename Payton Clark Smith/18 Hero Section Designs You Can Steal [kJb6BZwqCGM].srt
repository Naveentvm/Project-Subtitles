1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:02,725
Are you sick of using
the exact same layouts

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:06,000
for every hero section
of every website?

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:10,000
Well in this video, I'm going to share
with you 18 different hero variations

4
00:00:10,001 --> 00:00:13,566
that you can steal to start
using in your designs today.

5
00:00:13,591 --> 00:00:14,640
Let's get into it.

6
00:00:14,665 --> 00:00:18,000
Now the first hero layouts that I want
to cover are those that I would classify

7
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:19,001
as Ol' Reliable.

8
00:00:19,225 --> 00:00:21,101
These are layouts
that you're going to see

9
00:00:21,113 --> 00:00:23,000
all the time and there's
a reason that you

10
00:00:23,001 --> 00:00:24,000
see them all the time.

11
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:28,000
It's because they work in
terms of conversion, usability.

12
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,808
And the first and probably most common
is this classic left-right layout, right?

13
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:36,414
You've got your text and your call
to action on the left and the image

14
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:37,001
on the right.

15
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,526
A good example of
this is this stairs website

16
00:00:40,551 --> 00:00:42,000
and you can see
especially with a nice

17
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:43,041
graphic on the right side.

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,182
It's really going to bring
this basic layout to life.

19
00:00:46,207 --> 00:00:49,000
Another thing that you can do is
take that image on the right side and

20
00:00:49,001 --> 00:00:50,000
stretch it to the

21
00:00:50,001 --> 00:00:54,000
height of the viewport and by doing
this, it's going to create a little bit

22
00:00:54,025 --> 00:00:58,373
more of a custom feel. And I
really like this example by fino.

23
00:00:58,398 --> 00:01:00,758
Now, both of these
layouts can be flipped

24
00:01:00,783 --> 00:01:02,524
and so rather than
left-right, you're going

25
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:03,001
right-left.

26
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,040
Meaning you have the
image on the left and

27
00:01:05,052 --> 00:01:07,000
you have the text and
call to action on the

28
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:07,691
right.

29
00:01:07,716 --> 00:01:11,552
Now, while this is a nice way to
shake it up, I don't really recommend that

30
00:01:11,577 --> 00:01:13,966
you use this too
often because typically

31
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:17,000
speaking with most
languages, we read left

32
00:01:17,001 --> 00:01:17,580
to right.

33
00:01:17,605 --> 00:01:21,000
That's the way that we
look at websites as well.

34
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:22,506
So, If you've got the
image on the left, that's

35
00:01:22,518 --> 00:01:24,000
typically going to
be the first thing that

36
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:25,000
people look at.

37
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:29,000
So unless you've got a really powerful
image that conveys your message and

38
00:01:29,001 --> 00:01:30,001
your value proposition,

39
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:34,000
I wouldn't typically recommend
putting your image on the left.

40
00:01:34,001 --> 00:01:36,000
But there is a good example of this here.

41
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:40,000
They still do a good job of calling
attention to the text on the right side.

42
00:01:40,393 --> 00:01:42,534
So in this case, I feel
like it's kind of working.

43
00:01:42,647 --> 00:01:47,442
The other thing that you can do
is again, bring that image to the full

44
00:01:47,467 --> 00:01:49,549
height of the viewport.

45
00:01:49,574 --> 00:01:51,435
And here's another
great example of that.

46
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:51,740
All right.

47
00:01:51,765 --> 00:01:53,280
So the next one that
I want to talk about

48
00:01:53,306 --> 00:01:55,625
is one that I would
classify as Old School.

49
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:59,000
And the reason that I classify this as
Old School is that something that you

50
00:01:59,001 --> 00:02:00,001
would see years ago,

51
00:02:00,426 --> 00:02:02,286
and it makes
websites feel outdated.

52
00:02:02,311 --> 00:02:06,493
So I wouldn't really recommend this
one, but this layout is having the image

53
00:02:06,518 --> 00:02:10,445
on the background and then
the text as an overlay over the top.

54
00:02:10,845 --> 00:02:13,500
Now again, this can be done tastefully.

55
00:02:13,525 --> 00:02:17,560
And so I don't want to say you
should never use this, but it's really easy

56
00:02:17,585 --> 00:02:20,476
to kind of lose track
of the text in the image.

57
00:02:20,501 --> 00:02:22,216
But one example
that I really liked of this

58
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:25,000
is this website
Secret Developers.

59
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:29,000
You can see they've gotten a really
nice image on the backdrop, but they

60
00:02:29,001 --> 00:02:30,911
still are using
some bold text over

61
00:02:30,936 --> 00:02:34,626
the front to bring
your focus to that text.

62
00:02:34,651 --> 00:02:36,133
The one thing that
I don't like is the call

63
00:02:36,158 --> 00:02:39,000
to action is really
difficult to see over

64
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:39,640
the image.

65
00:02:39,665 --> 00:02:40,069
All right.

66
00:02:40,094 --> 00:02:42,642
So now we're going to
talk about centered layouts.

67
00:02:42,667 --> 00:02:45,061
I am actually a big
fan of centered layouts

68
00:02:45,073 --> 00:02:47,322
back in college when I
was taking design classes.

69
00:02:47,347 --> 00:02:50,842
My teachers would say you
should never center a line text.

70
00:02:50,867 --> 00:02:52,001
It's not tasteful.

71
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,000
It doesn't look good.

72
00:02:53,001 --> 00:02:54,989
But honestly, I think
it's kind of easy to

73
00:02:55,001 --> 00:02:57,000
consume and it keeps
things looking really

74
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:00,000
nice and flow really nicely.

75
00:03:00,001 --> 00:03:04,000
And so a few examples of this are just
this classic center layout where you've

76
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:06,500
got your text call to
action and then your image.

77
00:03:06,525 --> 00:03:09,045
And oftentimes that
image is going to kind

78
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:11,618
of flow out of the
bottom of the viewport,

79
00:03:11,643 --> 00:03:17,103
but as long as enough of that
image or video is showing, it's going to

80
00:03:17,128 --> 00:03:19,000
encourage people
to scroll to see more.

81
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:23,493
And here's a great example of
this from this website, Payking.

82
00:03:23,518 --> 00:03:27,876
The next one is a slight variation
of this centered layout where we're

83
00:03:27,901 --> 00:03:31,000
taking the image of bringing
it above the call to action.

84
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:32,798
I personally am not
a huge fan of this

85
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:35,000
because we want to
keep that call to action as

86
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:38,121
one of the main focal
points, but there are

87
00:03:38,133 --> 00:03:41,000
cases where this
can be done tastefully.

88
00:03:41,001 --> 00:03:45,881
In this case, Elaster Bank does kind
of a cool graphic that comes up and

89
00:03:45,906 --> 00:03:47,335
over the call to action

90
00:03:47,573 --> 00:03:51,000
might be something worth looking
into and trying in your designs.

91
00:03:51,001 --> 00:03:55,000
The next one that I really like is
the center line text and call to action

92
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:58,000
with a few images
floating around the size.

93
00:03:58,001 --> 00:04:02,000
This is a great example here,
HomeHero where they're actually using

94
00:04:02,225 --> 00:04:06,504
different like profile
pictures of happy people.

95
00:04:06,591 --> 00:04:08,471
This kind of conveys
their message.

96
00:04:08,496 --> 00:04:10,454
I'm a big fan of this.

97
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:15,225
I'm such a big fan of this that I've
even used in my own website, paitpro.

98
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,872
You can see that we've got a
couple of profile pictures with little like

99
00:04:18,897 --> 00:04:20,465
text boxes popping up.

100
00:04:20,671 --> 00:04:24,920
That kind of convey more about our
paitpro community for web designers.

101
00:04:24,945 --> 00:04:28,718
I'm a big fan of this and you can
see that I also used a slight variation

102
00:04:28,743 --> 00:04:32,758
where the video, our
promo video is showing

103
00:04:32,783 --> 00:04:36,325
just a little bit on the bottom of the
viewport which is encourages people to

104
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,244
scroll and watch that video.

105
00:04:38,269 --> 00:04:41,737
The next ones that I want to talk
about are horizontal variations and

106
00:04:41,762 --> 00:04:47,018
these are horizontally aligned in
terms of the text and call to action.

107
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,000
I think this is a really creative
way to lay out your hero section.

108
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,647
You can see here we've
got the main header

109
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:55,328
to the left, the sub-header
and the call to action

110
00:04:55,353 --> 00:04:58,000
to the right and then
the image down below.

111
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,000
A good example of this is spline.

112
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:02,649
I actually think they
do this pretty tastefully.

113
00:05:02,674 --> 00:05:07,666
They've got some cool imagery and
they have a great use of hierarchy so you

114
00:05:07,691 --> 00:05:09,100
know exactly
where to look.

115
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,000
You've got the big bold header.

116
00:05:11,001 --> 00:05:12,001
You've got the subtext.

117
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,000
You've got a colored call to action.

118
00:05:14,001 --> 00:05:16,414
They do this really, really well.

119
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:19,037
The next one is a
slight variation of that

120
00:05:19,049 --> 00:05:21,000
where you're actually
taking the subtext

121
00:05:21,001 --> 00:05:22,121
and moving this to the left.

122
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,613
I am not a fan of this
one because again,

123
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:27,000
traditionally we're
reading left to right

124
00:05:27,001 --> 00:05:31,000
and we don't want people to read the
subtext before they read the main text

125
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,000
or value

126
00:05:32,175 --> 00:05:35,455
proposition and this
kind of goes against

127
00:05:35,467 --> 00:05:39,000
basic philosophy of
hierarchy because you've

128
00:05:39,001 --> 00:05:43,000
got your main header in the
middle of its bigger so that should call

129
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:46,000
people's attention
a little bit more.

130
00:05:46,001 --> 00:05:48,283
But when they're
reading left to right,

131
00:05:48,295 --> 00:05:51,000
they're also prone to
read the sub text first.

132
00:05:51,001 --> 00:05:54,000
I just don't think that this is very
user friendly but it might be something

133
00:05:54,001 --> 00:05:56,000
worth trying out.

134
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:00,115
The next one is a
huge hero image

135
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,882
over the top and then
we've got our header

136
00:06:02,907 --> 00:06:05,000
and our sub header down below.

137
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:07,888
This is kind of an
interesting layout mainly

138
00:06:07,913 --> 00:06:09,721
because in the
examples that I found

139
00:06:09,746 --> 00:06:12,000
they don't really
have a call to action.

140
00:06:12,001 --> 00:06:13,846
However there are
occasionally websites

141
00:06:13,858 --> 00:06:15,701
where you don't really
need a call to action.

142
00:06:15,726 --> 00:06:17,824
They're just websites
that are built to

143
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:20,000
convey information and
so this might be layout

144
00:06:20,001 --> 00:06:22,013
that you want to use
if you have a website

145
00:06:22,025 --> 00:06:24,000
like that that doesn't
necessarily have a

146
00:06:24,001 --> 00:06:25,001
call to action.

147
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,830
The next layouts that
I want to talk about

148
00:06:26,855 --> 00:06:29,000
are those that I
classified as quirky.

149
00:06:29,001 --> 00:06:32,372
These are ones that I wouldn't necessarily
recommend using on an everyday

150
00:06:32,397 --> 00:06:37,000
basis, but they might be fun
variations to try in some of your designs.

151
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:40,796
The first one utilizes somewhat of a
background image where you've got the

152
00:06:40,821 --> 00:06:42,000
text that slightly

153
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:43,911
overlays the image
and then we've got

154
00:06:43,923 --> 00:06:46,000
our sub header down
to the bottom right.

155
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,000
This is kind of a
cool example of that.

156
00:06:49,001 --> 00:06:50,417
Now with this you
want to make sure that

157
00:06:50,429 --> 00:06:52,000
there's a lot of contrast
between the header

158
00:06:52,001 --> 00:06:53,964
and the image and
so you're going to have

159
00:06:53,976 --> 00:06:56,000
to be really careful
with what you choose.

160
00:06:56,001 --> 00:06:58,458
I also sometimes see
variations where the

161
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:01,313
text overlays it would
invert to the color white.

162
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:06,206
So again this may not be the easiest
to read but it is kind of a cool way to

163
00:07:06,231 --> 00:07:08,095
shake up your hero section.

164
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:11,777
The next example
is a slight variation

165
00:07:11,802 --> 00:07:14,000
from what we've talked
about in some of the past

166
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:16,161
examples but you've
got your header centered

167
00:07:16,173 --> 00:07:18,000
up top, you've got
an image down below

168
00:07:18,001 --> 00:07:21,442
and then you've got your sub-header
and the call to action in the bottom right.

169
00:07:21,757 --> 00:07:25,016
I kind of like this example because
you've got a big fat burger in the

170
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:26,463
bottom left, but you

171
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:30,052
still are utilizing hierarchy and
people are going to be able to read kind

172
00:07:30,077 --> 00:07:32,001
of left, center to right.

173
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,000
So this one actually works
pretty well and I kind of like this.

174
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:39,000
The next example is actually
one that I'm a big fan of.

175
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:40,447
The only thing you
have to be careful of

176
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:42,026
is making sure that
this doesn't become too

177
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:44,868
overwhelming but
you've got all of your

178
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,000
important info to the left,
your text, call to action,

179
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,344
you've got an image in the
center and then you've got some

180
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:54,595
additional text or even
buttons to the right

181
00:07:54,815 --> 00:07:57,368
and I really like this
example of trend.

182
00:07:57,393 --> 00:08:01,000
You can see that again you're still
going to be reading left to right, big

183
00:08:01,001 --> 00:08:03,000
text down to call to action.

184
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:06,000
You've got a really cool image in
the center but then on the right you

185
00:08:06,001 --> 00:08:10,000
actually have buttons that are
sliders to change that image.

186
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:13,576
Again you want to be careful to not
overwhelm people with too much in your

187
00:08:13,601 --> 00:08:14,448
hero section

188
00:08:14,601 --> 00:08:17,796
but this is a cool variation that I
would definitely recommend trying out in

189
00:08:17,821 --> 00:08:18,332
your designs.

190
00:08:18,357 --> 00:08:23,000
The next example is again just a
slight change up from the ones we just

191
00:08:23,001 --> 00:08:24,001
spoke about but

192
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,626
we've got our text and
then our call to action

193
00:08:26,651 --> 00:08:29,000
kind of slanting
to the right starting

194
00:08:29,001 --> 00:08:32,000
from the center and then
we've got images on the left.

195
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:35,627
Again you want to be careful using
your images on the left just because

196
00:08:35,652 --> 00:08:36,150
that's what people

197
00:08:36,175 --> 00:08:40,000
are probably going to see first but
there are ways to do this tastefully.

198
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:44,000
It's showing these books on the
left which I actually think in this case it

199
00:08:44,001 --> 00:08:45,918
really works because
it's showing some of

200
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:48,000
what they're offering
and so I actually like

201
00:08:48,001 --> 00:08:49,000
this and then

202
00:08:49,025 --> 00:08:51,471
their call to action
the bottom right is a

203
00:08:51,483 --> 00:08:54,000
search bar rather than
a button which again

204
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:57,000
depending on the purpose of
your website can work really well.

205
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:02,000
The next one that I'm actually a
huge fan of is this slight centered

206
00:09:02,001 --> 00:09:03,000
variation but instead

207
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:07,000
of having everything centered you've
got your subtext and call to action on

208
00:09:07,001 --> 00:09:09,424
a horizontal alignment
and then you've

209
00:09:09,436 --> 00:09:12,000
got images to the
left and to the right.

210
00:09:12,001 --> 00:09:15,000
This website puzzle is a
really cool example of this.

211
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:20,000
The images are not necessarily descriptive
but they are on brand and they're

212
00:09:20,001 --> 00:09:21,001
really bright

213
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,534
and colorful and fun
and then I also like

214
00:09:23,546 --> 00:09:26,000
that they're calling
more attention to the

215
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,000
call to action with the little arrow.

216
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:32,000
So this is a really cool variation
that I'm definitely going to be using.

217
00:09:32,001 --> 00:09:34,915
The next one is a
variation that I'm not

218
00:09:34,927 --> 00:09:38,000
super thrilled about
but they are somewhat

219
00:09:38,001 --> 00:09:40,326
sticking to the
whole idea of header

220
00:09:40,338 --> 00:09:42,293
to the left and then
moving to the right.

221
00:09:42,526 --> 00:09:44,099
The only problem
is the header is in the

222
00:09:44,124 --> 00:09:46,506
bottom left and then
they've got big images

223
00:09:46,531 --> 00:09:49,569
right here in the center
kind of slanting down.

224
00:09:49,695 --> 00:09:52,075
You can see in this
example here the reason

225
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,000
that this one is working
is because those

226
00:09:55,001 --> 00:10:00,000
images are portraying what it
is that they offer or what they do.

227
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:04,000
It's the UI of their app but again
this can get a little confusing when

228
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,000
people are looking

229
00:10:05,001 --> 00:10:07,176
they're going to start at the top
left and then go to the bottom left to

230
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,000
read the header

231
00:10:08,001 --> 00:10:10,000
and then they're going to go to the
center to see the images and then top

232
00:10:10,001 --> 00:10:11,000
right to read the

233
00:10:11,001 --> 00:10:11,964
subtext and then
they're going to wander

234
00:10:11,976 --> 00:10:13,208
with a call to action
and they're gonna

235
00:10:13,233 --> 00:10:17,559
go to the bottom-right and so it can
get kind of overwhelming but it might

236
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:18,964
be something worth trying out.

237
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,012
The next variation
this is something that

238
00:10:22,024 --> 00:10:24,000
I have really loved
and I'm seeing this more

239
00:10:24,001 --> 00:10:30,578
often and this is using a standard
layout but instead of having imagery in a

240
00:10:30,603 --> 00:10:36,244
traditional location like left, right,
center they've got it within the header

241
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:37,384
and this is a really

242
00:10:37,409 --> 00:10:44,713
fun way to express more in the
main h1 of your website and like

243
00:10:44,738 --> 00:10:47,143
they say, "A picture is
worth a thousand words"

244
00:10:47,168 --> 00:10:52,000
and so if you're trying to
say more in the main text of

245
00:10:52,001 --> 00:10:53,001
your hero section

246
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,555
this might be the
variation for you and I

247
00:10:55,567 --> 00:10:58,000
really like this example
you can see they've

248
00:10:58,001 --> 00:11:01,300
got different images between
creative agency for the ocean.

249
00:11:01,546 --> 00:11:03,291
I'm obsessed with this layout.

250
00:11:03,358 --> 00:11:06,600
It is a little bit more
quirky, a little bit

251
00:11:06,612 --> 00:11:09,504
more out there but
if you do it in a very

252
00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:12,383
conservative way, I think
it can work really well.
