00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,595
Hi everyone, this is Andy with Blungo.com
and in this video we're going to do

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,000
a quick overview of Zoho Tables.

3
00:00:07,001 --> 00:00:09,000
This is like a spreadsheet on steroids.

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,706
You will be able to
create and connect tables

5
00:00:11,718 --> 00:00:14,000
so they share
information as well as set

6
00:00:14,001 --> 00:00:16,183
up automations and a lot more.

7
00:00:16,323 --> 00:00:18,330
Alright let's get started.

8
00:00:18,355 --> 00:00:22,000
Keep in mind that Zoho Tables is in
beta at the moment of the recording

9
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:23,001
of this video.

10
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,000
So, some features might change by
the time that the version 1 is released.

11
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:31,000
You can request early access
using the link in the description.

12
00:00:31,001 --> 00:00:35,000
This is a base that we use to
track and analyze user feedback.

13
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:37,000
This base contains two tables.

14
00:00:37,001 --> 00:00:40,000
User feedback and feedback analysis.

15
00:00:40,001 --> 00:00:43,000
And each table contains views
that we're going to review later.

16
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:46,000
As you can see it is very similar to a
spreadsheet but there are some extra

17
00:00:46,001 --> 00:00:48,000
fields like the attaching ones.

18
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:52,000
To add a new field, click on
the plus button and select one.

19
00:00:52,001 --> 00:00:57,484
We have many options here like AutoNumber,
Collaborator, Formula, Rating but

20
00:00:57,509 --> 00:00:59,898
two really important
fields are the link field

21
00:00:59,922 --> 00:01:02,385
that will let you connect
tables and the lookup

22
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,225
field that will
allow you to bring

23
00:01:04,237 --> 00:01:07,000
information to a table
from another table.

24
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,743
Let's add a date field.

25
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:14,736
Now we can select
dates on this field.

26
00:01:17,762 --> 00:01:20,000
You can also use the
Manage Fields button.

27
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:24,000
In case your table has many fields
and you want to quickly make changes or

28
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:25,130
add new fields.

29
00:01:25,556 --> 00:01:30,096
If you want to delete a record, just
click on this arrow and then on Delete.

30
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:34,149
To add a record to this
table, we have several options.

31
00:01:34,476 --> 00:01:38,309
The first one is to click on an
empty cell and type the information in.

32
00:01:40,523 --> 00:01:44,000
The second way is to click
on the Add a Record button.

33
00:01:44,001 --> 00:01:46,000
Then just complete
the fields and that's it.

34
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,000
The record will be added.

35
00:01:48,001 --> 00:01:50,000
The last one is by using a form.

36
00:01:50,001 --> 00:01:53,679
This table already has a form but later
on I will show you how to create one.

37
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:56,896
Under Views, we can see Feedback Form.

38
00:01:57,243 --> 00:01:58,050
Let's open it.

39
00:01:59,503 --> 00:02:01,041
Here we can edit the form.

40
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,000
For example if we need to change
the name of the fields or hide fields.

41
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,989
But the cool part is
that you can click on

42
00:02:07,015 --> 00:02:10,270
Get Form URL and
then if you open the link,

43
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,836
it will bring you to the form that you
can use to add records to your table.

44
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:17,716
You can share these form with others
so they can add records without having

45
00:02:17,741 --> 00:02:19,000
to open the table.

46
00:02:19,001 --> 00:02:20,891
Before we continue,
I wanted to mention

47
00:02:20,903 --> 00:02:24,000
that we have created a
Zoho one course for admins.

48
00:02:24,001 --> 00:02:26,754
So, if you're interested, check
out the link in the description.

49
00:02:26,787 --> 00:02:28,189
Ok. Let's close this.

50
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:30,019
And this.

51
00:02:31,593 --> 00:02:35,263
Up here we can see that there is
another table called Feedback Analysis.

52
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:39,000
This table is similar to the
other one but has more fields.

53
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,723
Like a drop down called Category
and a multi select called Tags.

54
00:02:43,783 --> 00:02:46,202
But it also has this
link field that links

55
00:02:46,227 --> 00:02:48,402
this table with the
user feedback table.

56
00:02:48,427 --> 00:02:50,941
And also lookup field
that is showing the

57
00:02:50,953 --> 00:02:53,000
feedback text from
the other table as well.

58
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,000
This table has different views.

59
00:02:56,001 --> 00:03:00,000
The deadlines view is a calendar
view that shows when the records do.

60
00:03:00,001 --> 00:03:02,000
The grey boxes are the records.

61
00:03:02,001 --> 00:03:05,017
You can click on any of them to
see more information about the record.

62
00:03:05,513 --> 00:03:09,312
Another view is called Actionable
Feedback which is very similar to the

63
00:03:09,337 --> 00:03:11,000
default view but it is filter.

64
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:15,000
It is only showing records where
the actionable field is checked.

65
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,943
Finally, we have the Stacked by
Category view which is a kanban view.

66
00:03:20,356 --> 00:03:24,396
You can move a record from one column
to another one by dragging and dropping it.

67
00:03:24,682 --> 00:03:26,642
To create a new
view, click on this plus

68
00:03:26,667 --> 00:03:29,137
button and then select the
view that you want to create.

69
00:03:29,303 --> 00:03:31,201
Here's where you
can set up a new form.

70
00:03:31,225 --> 00:03:34,436
Keep in mind that the views you
create here are for this table only.

71
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:37,000
OK, let's select Gallery.

72
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,256
And the view has been created.

73
00:03:38,523 --> 00:03:40,183
On the side panel,
you can drag and drop

74
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:41,884
more fields that will
show on the cards.

75
00:03:42,944 --> 00:03:46,743
To delete a view, click on the
three dots and then on delete.

76
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,450
If you want to add a new table
to your base, click on this button.

77
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:57,024
Then select if you want to start
with an empty table or import a file.

78
00:03:57,684 --> 00:04:01,000
You can import spreadsheets and
CSV files that you already have from your

79
00:04:01,001 --> 00:04:03,000
computer or from the cloud.

80
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,000
Let's go back and create a blank table.

81
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:12,162
Here you can start adding new
records and link them to the other tables.

82
00:04:12,536 --> 00:04:16,000
To delete a table, click on
this arrow and then on delete.

83
00:04:19,116 --> 00:04:22,000
On the right side, we
can see the log button.

84
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,263
This panel shows
all the changes made

85
00:04:24,288 --> 00:04:27,000
to this table in a
chronological order.

86
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:29,000
The next button is the
Automations button.

87
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,417
It allows you to create basic automations
within the tables in this space.

88
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,669
For example, this one sends
email when a record is created.

89
00:04:37,489 --> 00:04:40,609
Other actions are to create a
record and to update a record.

90
00:04:40,883 --> 00:04:44,000
I think the list of possible
automations will increase over time.

91
00:04:44,001 --> 00:04:48,000
If you want to share this space, click
on the Share button and either share

92
00:04:48,001 --> 00:04:51,004
via email or by selecting
the coloborators in your team.

93
00:04:52,671 --> 00:04:55,649
If you click on the tables logo,
you will land on the home screen.

94
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,000
Here you can find your bases.

95
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,142
In my case, I have two.

96
00:04:59,529 --> 00:05:01,457
You can add more
bases with this button.

97
00:05:01,963 --> 00:05:04,410
One extra option that
we have here is templates.

98
00:05:05,476 --> 00:05:09,013
There are templates for many use
cases on this section that Zoho included.

99
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,615
So you don't have to start
building bases from scratch.

100
00:05:12,489 --> 00:05:14,377
The last thing I want
to show you is that

101
00:05:14,402 --> 00:05:16,682
you can have multiple
workspaces you need to.

102
00:05:16,955 --> 00:05:20,776
If you're part of multiple teams, each
team can have its own workspace.

103
00:05:20,849 --> 00:05:23,890
You can manage workspace
members by clicking here.

104
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,821
Alright, I hope you
guys enjoyed the video

105
00:05:27,846 --> 00:05:30,000
and if you did, please
click the like button.

106
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,263
If you're a Zoho admin
and would like to learn

107
00:05:32,288 --> 00:05:35,001
more about how to
integrate different Zoho apps,

108
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,138
we made a Zoho one
course where we go over

109
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:41,000
how to configure and
integrate the top 10

110
00:05:41,001 --> 00:05:43,000
most used Zoho one apps.

111
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:45,413
Check out the link in the
description for more information.

112
00:05:45,713 --> 00:05:47,001
Thanks for watching.
