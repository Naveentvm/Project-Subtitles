Hi everyone, this is Andy with
Blungo.com and in this video I'm going to

2
00:00:03,685 --> 00:00:05,441
show you how to automatically

3
00:00:05,466 --> 00:00:11,000
create a related record using a
function in Zoho CRM. For this example,

4
00:00:11,001 --> 00:00:13,000
when a deal is moved to

5
00:00:13,001 --> 00:00:17,000
closed won, it will create a related
record in the jobs module. In the

6
00:00:17,001 --> 00:00:19,000
description, you can find a

7
00:00:19,075 --> 00:00:22,724
blog post with the written step-by-step
tutorial, as well as the code that

8
00:00:22,749 --> 00:00:24,000
we're going to use today.

9
00:00:24,225 --> 00:00:28,211
Alright, let's get started. There are
two ways to create a related records.

10
00:00:28,425 --> 00:00:29,691
The first one is to use

11
00:00:29,716 --> 00:00:33,738
the workflow action, create a
related records, but it is limited on what

12
00:00:33,763 --> 00:00:35,000
information you can pass to

13
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:38,505
the related record. Then the ways to
use a function, and that's how we're

14
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,000
going to do it in this tutorial.

15
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:44,000
This is the deal we're going to use.
And if we scroll down, we can see that

16
00:00:44,001 --> 00:00:45,000
we have these three

17
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:48,627
fields that we would like to pass to
the related record. It is a drop-down

18
00:00:48,652 --> 00:00:50,100
field, a date field,

19
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:54,175
and a user field. So besides creating
the record, we're going to copy some

20
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,200
information as well.

21
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,000
The first thing we have to do is
go to the CRM setup, and then open

22
00:00:59,001 --> 00:01:00,000
the module where the

23
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:04,000
related record is going to be created.
In my case, I want to create a job

24
00:01:04,175 --> 00:01:05,316
after a deal is won,

25
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,579
so I'm going to open
the jobs module, which

26
00:01:07,591 --> 00:01:10,000
is a custom module.
And open the layout.

27
00:01:11,703 --> 00:01:15,316
Here, I already have the fields that
need to be mapped from the deal,

28
00:01:15,402 --> 00:01:17,000
but I'm going to add one more

29
00:01:17,001 --> 00:01:18,836
field that will link
these two modules.

30
00:01:18,861 --> 00:01:21,456
It is a lookup field. So
let's drag and drop it.

31
00:01:23,226 --> 00:01:26,305
And in this new window,
let's name it, deal related.

32
00:01:26,899 --> 00:01:29,001
The module lookup
is going to be deals.

33
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:33,745
And the related list
is going to be jobs.

34
00:01:34,169 --> 00:01:35,089
Click on Done.

35
00:01:36,089 --> 00:01:38,238
Okay, we have all
the fields we need,

36
00:01:38,263 --> 00:01:39,304
so let's save this
layout.

37
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:43,093
Now we have to
create a function.

38
00:01:43,763 --> 00:01:45,131
In this tab, I already have the

39
00:01:45,156 --> 00:01:46,416
functions page open.

40
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:48,984
We are going to
create a new function.

41
00:01:49,663 --> 00:01:51,350
Let's add a name
and a display name.

42
00:01:54,196 --> 00:01:56,036
The category is going
to be automation.

43
00:01:57,419 --> 00:01:58,421
Click on create.

44
00:02:00,786 --> 00:02:02,383
The code is in the blog post.

45
00:02:02,576 --> 00:02:03,854
I have it open right here.

46
00:02:04,888 --> 00:02:06,536
Scroll down until
you find the code.

47
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,097
Select it.

48
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,720
And copy it.

49
00:02:14,313 --> 00:02:15,647
Back to the function.

50
00:02:17,486 --> 00:02:18,833
And paste it right here.

51
00:02:19,793 --> 00:02:21,546
Next, we have to
add an argument.

52
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:28,543
So click on edit argument
and add deal_id as a string.

53
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,575
This is the information
that will be passed to the

54
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,183
function from the workflow
that we're going to create later.

55
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,363
Click on save.

56
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:39,206
And now I'm going to
explain what the function does.

57
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:41,693
But before I do that, I
wanted to mention that

58
00:02:41,718 --> 00:02:44,238
we have created a Zoho
one course for admins.

59
00:02:44,263 --> 00:02:47,060
So if you're interested, check
out the link in the description.

60
00:02:47,206 --> 00:02:51,445
So the function first gets the deal
information based on the Deal ID.

61
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,485
Then it grabs the
information located in the

62
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,300
different deal fields that
we want to copy to the job.

63
00:02:57,533 --> 00:03:00,470
In this case, estimator,
type and closing date.

64
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:05,000
The estimator is a user field.
That's why we need to get the ID.

65
00:03:05,001 --> 00:03:10,000
Then it is creating the job record name,
which is the word job and the deal name.

66
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:13,813
Then it maps all the fields
from the deal to the job record.

67
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,703
Finally, it creates the record.

68
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:18,244
You have to make sure
that you're using the right

69
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:21,000
API names in the function.
The two most important

70
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:23,000
fields are deal_related,

71
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:27,000
which is the lookup field we added
before and jobs, which is the module API

72
00:03:27,001 --> 00:03:29,000
name. To find them,

73
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:34,000
go to the API names in the CRM settings.
These are all the module API names.

74
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,796
If we scroll down,

75
00:03:35,821 --> 00:03:39,206
we can see the jobs module
and on the right, the API name

76
00:03:39,373 --> 00:03:42,000
to find API names
just open the module.

77
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,983
Here is the
deal_related API name.

78
00:03:46,043 --> 00:03:48,550
You can switch to all
their modules with this filter.

79
00:03:50,503 --> 00:03:51,730
Okay, back to the function.

80
00:03:52,777 --> 00:03:54,930
At this point, you can
click on save and execute

81
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:56,433
if you want to
test this function.

82
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:59,140
In my case, I know it works.
So I'm just going to save it.

83
00:04:01,173 --> 00:04:04,000
All right, the function is ready.
So now we need to create a workflow.

84
00:04:04,393 --> 00:04:08,489
I have the workflow section open
on this tab. Let's create a new rule.

85
00:04:09,961 --> 00:04:11,503
The module is deals.

86
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:13,763
Add a name.

87
00:04:15,623 --> 00:04:16,877
And click on next.

88
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:20,956
Here, select record action.

89
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:23,803
Edit.

90
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,650
Specific field gets modified.

91
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,170
When the stage is modified to.

92
00:04:32,423 --> 00:04:33,576
The value.

93
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:35,743
Closed Won.

94
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,177
Next

95
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:41,237
this rule is going
to apply to all deals.

96
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:42,729
Next

97
00:04:44,277 --> 00:04:46,057
and the action is
going to be function.

98
00:04:47,383 --> 00:04:49,203
In this box, click on functions.

99
00:04:50,503 --> 00:04:53,363
And click on configure next
to the function we just created.

100
00:04:54,823 --> 00:04:58,976
This is the parameter we're passing
to the function. So press the pound key,

101
00:04:59,586 --> 00:05:06,000
module is deals. And field is Deal
ID. And click on save and associate.

102
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The workflow is ready. So let's save it.

103
00:05:10,789 --> 00:05:13,310
All right, we can now test
if this automation works.

104
00:05:13,543 --> 00:05:15,000
Let's go back to the deal

105
00:05:15,456 --> 00:05:16,716
and refresh the page.

106
00:05:20,549 --> 00:05:23,763
On the related list, we
can now see the jobs tab.

107
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:26,968
Okay, let's move the deal
to the closed won stage,

108
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,406
which will trigger the workflow.

109
00:05:29,513 --> 00:05:31,400
And refresh the
page one more time.

110
00:05:34,413 --> 00:05:36,521
And now we can see that
there's a record right there.

111
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,113
So let's click on the list.

112
00:05:39,743 --> 00:05:41,583
The job record has been
created.

113
00:05:41,627 --> 00:05:44,049
And the name is job
plus the deal name.

114
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,150
Let 's open it.

115
00:05:47,423 --> 00:05:50,000
And the three fields have
been mapped correctly.

116
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,126
All right, I hope you
guys enjoyed the video.

117
00:05:53,151 --> 00:05:55,025

If you're a Zoho admin
and would like to learn

119
00:05:57,609 --> 00:06:00,189
more about how to integrate
the different Zoho apps,

120
00:06:00,462 --> 00:06:05,000
we made a Zoho one course where
we go over how to configure and

121
00:06:05,001 --> 00:06:06,000
integrate the top 10

122
00:06:06,001 --> 00:06:10,000
most used Zoho one apps. Check
