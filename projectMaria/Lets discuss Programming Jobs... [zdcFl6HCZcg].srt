1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,568
First of all, before this video starts,
I would like to give a big thank you

2
00:00:03,593 --> 00:00:05,000
to all of my new subscribers.

3
00:00:05,001 --> 00:00:09,000
I was not expecting even one
subscriber to be honest, so to wake up this

4
00:00:09,001 --> 00:00:11,000
morning and see a
hundred people following me,

5
00:00:11,001 --> 00:00:16,000
I was a bit surprised. So thank you
so much for liking my content, and I

6
00:00:16,001 --> 00:00:19,000
hope you stick around in the
future for even more content.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
About two days ago, I gave my final
presentation on my senior project, which

8
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,000
fingers crossed went really well,

9
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:37,000
meaning that in a couple of weeks
now, I will finally graduate college.

10
00:00:38,985 --> 00:00:44,000
I mean, it just feels so great to finally
be free of homework assignments,

11
00:00:44,001 --> 00:00:49,000
projects, and free from the goddamn
elevator that breaks every two weeks.

12
00:00:49,001 --> 00:00:52,619
Finally, I'm able to do
whatever I want as a free adult.

13
00:00:57,406 --> 00:01:02,000
Who are you? Yeah, Hi. Did
you check your bank account?

14
00:01:02,025 --> 00:01:05,024
What do you mean, check?
Just check your bank account.

15
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:14,000
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I should probably
get a job. It's kind of funny how college

16
00:01:14,225 --> 00:01:17,000
just kind of takes your
money in the after four years,

17
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:21,000
throws you out to the streets, and
says, "Good luck on finding a job!"

18
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,000
And, you know, please, when you get
money, pay us even more. It's like the

19
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:25,000
first couple thousand dollars

20
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:29,000
were not enough for them, but I do
want to agree that college does not have

21
00:01:29,001 --> 00:01:31,000
to baby you through all the steps of life.

22
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:35,000
Finding a career is something
that you have to do all on your own.

23
00:01:35,001 --> 00:01:40,000
But anyway, because I'm soon going
to need to find a job, I wanted to spend

24
00:01:40,001 --> 00:01:42,064
some time and
research a little bit about

25
00:01:42,076 --> 00:01:44,000
the possible jobs
there are out there.

26
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:48,467
Because one of the beautiful things
about being a programmer is that you're

27
00:01:48,492 --> 00:01:51,051
not really limited to
just working in one field,

28
00:01:51,076 --> 00:01:55,000
which is amazing because
imagine if you're majoring in art

29
00:01:55,001 --> 00:01:59,000
history, I'm so sorry, but here we
out put down your paint brushes.

30
00:01:59,001 --> 00:02:02,000
No, I don't think art historians paint.

31
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:09,000
Put down your art textbooks. What I
mean by this is that as an art historian,

32
00:02:09,225 --> 00:02:14,000
I think the only place you really
work in is a museum or something.

33
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:19,000
As a programmer, however, you have
many different fields to choose from. You

34
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:22,000
could work as a programmer in
the medical field. You could work as a

35
00:02:22,001 --> 00:02:24,000
programmer in the finance field.

36
00:02:24,001 --> 00:02:29,000
You can work in robotics, in avionics,
heck, you could even work at Roblox.

37
00:02:29,001 --> 00:02:33,000
You're laughing, but I kid you
not, that's where the real money is.

38
00:02:33,075 --> 00:02:36,026
Look it up, I swear. And so today
I'm going to spend a little bit time going

39
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:41,000
through various different fields and
figuring out what they are and what it

40
00:02:41,001 --> 00:02:44,000
takes to become whatever
it is you're going to become.

41
00:02:44,001 --> 00:02:47,000
Disclaimer, I spent a little bit of
time researching this so that I don't

42
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:51,000
sound like an idiot. But if I do get
something wrong, please let me know in

43
00:02:51,001 --> 00:02:51,000
the comments.

44
00:02:51,001 --> 00:02:56,000
After a little bit of researching, I've
compiled a bit of information about

45
00:02:56,001 --> 00:02:58,000
some of the most popular jobs there are.

46
00:02:58,025 --> 00:03:03,000
And the most basic jobs that usually
pop up are computer programmers and

47
00:03:03,001 --> 00:03:04,000
software engineers.

48
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:08,000
Now you might be thinking, aren't
those the same thing? I mean, they surely

49
00:03:08,001 --> 00:03:09,041
sound like the same thing.

50
00:03:09,225 --> 00:03:13,000
I mean, a software engineer just
kind of sounds like a fancier version of a

51
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:14,000
computer programmer.

52
00:03:14,001 --> 00:03:18,000
Oh, what do you do for a job? Oh, I
write computer programs. Oh, cool, cool.

53
00:03:18,001 --> 00:03:21,543
What do you do for a job?
I engineer software.

54
00:03:23,057 --> 00:03:28,000
Oh, okay. But there is a difference though.
So let me first explain what a

55
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:29,000
computer programmer is.

56
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:33,000
A computer programmer at the most
basic level is someone who can write,

57
00:03:33,001 --> 00:03:35,000
modify, and test code.

58
00:03:35,001 --> 00:03:37,000
Although we all know that you're
probably going to spend like 10% of the

59
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:38,000
time writing code.

60
00:03:38,001 --> 00:03:41,000
The other 90% of the time baying
your head against the wall because

61
00:03:41,001 --> 00:03:42,001
something isn't working.

62
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:46,000
Don't you just love being a programmer?
You should generally be proficient

63
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,000
in at least one type of language

64
00:03:48,001 --> 00:03:51,000
and have a basic knowledge of computer
science principles. So we help us to

65
00:03:51,001 --> 00:03:52,000
see what's trending

66
00:03:52,001 --> 00:03:56,000
at the time in the programming world
to see what language you should learn.

67
00:03:56,001 --> 00:03:57,000
And now we have the

68
00:03:57,001 --> 00:04:01,000
software engineer. To put it simply,
they're not only responsible for

69
00:04:01,001 --> 00:04:02,000
writing the code,

70
00:04:02,001 --> 00:04:05,000
they're responsible for coming up
with the concept of the code. You can

71
00:04:05,001 --> 00:04:06,000
think of this as a mechanic

72
00:04:06,001 --> 00:04:11,000
is able to put a car together with
a bunch of parts, but a mechanical.

73
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,000
engineer can understand

74
00:04:13,001 --> 00:04:17,000
the individual functionality of each
part as well as probably design the car

75
00:04:17,028 --> 00:04:17,841
from scratch himself.

76
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:22,000
These two fields work together in
a way where the software engineer

77
00:04:22,001 --> 00:04:24,063
spends time developing
a specific software

78
00:04:24,075 --> 00:04:26,000
and then works
together with a bunch of

79
00:04:26,001 --> 00:04:27,000
computer programmers

80
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:31,000
to make the completed version of the
software. And now the most important

81
00:04:31,001 --> 00:04:33,000
part, salary. According to

82
00:04:33,001 --> 00:04:39,000
the Bureau of Labor Statistics, computer
programmers earn an average of 93k

83
00:04:39,001 --> 00:04:41,000
a year, which is pretty good

84
00:04:41,001 --> 00:04:46,000
if I say so myself. While a software
engineer averages at 120k a year, but

85
00:04:46,001 --> 00:04:47,001
do not confuse this

86
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:52,000
with the starting salary. On average
for a starting salary, I'm seeing

87
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:54,000
online a mix between

88
00:04:54,001 --> 00:04:58,000
60k a year or 70k a year at a
starting salary. If you're lucky, you could

89
00:04:58,001 --> 00:05:00,000
get something higher than that

90
00:05:00,025 --> 00:05:05,000
and if you get something lower than that.
Anyway, let's move away from these

91
00:05:05,001 --> 00:05:06,000
really broad career

92
00:05:06,001 --> 00:05:09,000
topics. And I want to talk a little
bit about these three jobs that I keep

93
00:05:09,001 --> 00:05:10,001
seeing pop up,

94
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,000
which let's start with front end
development. Front end development works at

95
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:16,417
the front end of
applications, which is

96
00:05:16,429 --> 00:05:19,000
where the UI exists.
You're dealing with the

97
00:05:19,001 --> 00:05:20,000
buttons, you're dealing

98
00:05:20,001 --> 00:05:23,000
with the images, you're dealing
with the layout and the design of the

99
00:05:23,001 --> 00:05:24,000
website itself. Now,

100
00:05:24,001 --> 00:05:27,000
this point has seemed like
something really difficult, but in fact, it

101
00:05:27,001 --> 00:05:29,000
actually is pretty hard to

102
00:05:29,025 --> 00:05:32,054
create a really
good user interface.

103
00:05:34,407 --> 00:05:35,633
What is going on here?

104
00:05:39,525 --> 00:05:41,075
What am I looking
at? And so if you're

105
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,000
going to be working with the UI,
it's definitely going to require a bit of

106
00:05:44,001 --> 00:05:45,001
more creative

107
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:49,000
psychology. And that's essentially all
that front end development is. You're

108
00:05:49,001 --> 00:05:50,000
going to need to know

109
00:05:50,001 --> 00:05:56,000
a little bit of HTML or CSS. Now,
moving on to, I wouldn't call the opposite

110
00:05:56,001 --> 00:05:57,000
of it, but at the

111
00:05:57,001 --> 00:06:01,000
opposite end of front end, you have
the back end, the back end deals with

112
00:06:01,001 --> 00:06:02,000
the functionality of the

113
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:06,000
front end. So you have the buttons,
you have the very cool, the animated

114
00:06:06,001 --> 00:06:07,001
portfolio website,

115
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:11,000
but do the buttons work. Do you need
a database that you need to search? All

116
00:06:11,001 --> 00:06:12,000
of this is the

117
00:06:12,001 --> 00:06:16,000
responsibility of the backend developer.
For this, you would mainly learn

118
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,000
maybe JavaScript. There's

119
00:06:18,001 --> 00:06:20,000
also a bunch of other languages out there.
You have the love child, the full

120
00:06:20,001 --> 00:06:21,000
stack developer,

121
00:06:21,001 --> 00:06:26,000
full stack developers work in both front
end and back end development. They

122
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:28,036
are the Jack of all
trades. Now, let's talk

123
00:06:28,048 --> 00:06:30,000
about salaries. This
is where I got a bit

124
00:06:30,001 --> 00:06:32,000
confused looking up online

125
00:06:32,001 --> 00:06:37,000
because they're giving a bunch of
different variety of salaries. Like, and

126
00:06:37,001 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm just going to say

127
00:06:38,001 --> 00:06:41,026
that I think they're
all within the range

128
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:44,000
of 100k. Again, not
the starting salary,

129
00:06:44,001 --> 00:06:49,493
but the possible future salary.
Going even deeper down the rabbit hole,

130
00:06:49,518 --> 00:06:52,346
There're even more
specific specializations.

131
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:55,000
Cyber security is a field
where you're working

132
00:06:55,001 --> 00:06:56,000
with encryption and making

133
00:06:56,001 --> 00:07:01,000
sure that data in websites or
applications is not get leaked to hackers.

134
00:07:01,001 --> 00:07:03,000
There's also cloud computing.

135
00:07:03,025 --> 00:07:06,000
This is a field where essentially
working on delivering different types of

136
00:07:06,001 --> 00:07:08,000
computer resources to

137
00:07:08,001 --> 00:07:11,459
different people over the Internet.
Another important field is data

138
00:07:11,484 --> 00:07:13,000
scientists, which are people

139
00:07:13,001 --> 00:07:17,859
who work on a load of data that is
given to them and try to make sense of it.

140
00:07:17,884 --> 00:07:19,000
The reason I'm able

141
00:07:19,001 --> 00:07:23,000
to look up all the salaries is because
some data scientists did their job.

142
00:07:23,001 --> 00:07:24,000
And there was just so

143
00:07:24,001 --> 00:07:27,000
many more specialized jobs out
there that if I try to put them all in one

144
00:07:27,001 --> 00:07:28,000
video, I would be sitting

145
00:07:28,001 --> 00:07:32,000
here for an hour and that's just
going to be too long to edit. So I'm not

146
00:07:32,001 --> 00:07:33,000
going to go any further.

147
00:07:33,001 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm going to link some pages of
where I found all this information. If you

148
00:07:36,001 --> 00:07:37,000
want to take a look at

149
00:07:37,001 --> 00:07:41,000
some more fields that there are.
But for now, I'm going to move on to two

150
00:07:41,001 --> 00:07:42,000
fields that I find

151
00:07:42,001 --> 00:07:45,000
incredibly interesting myself.
The first is game development. Now, this

152
00:07:45,001 --> 00:07:46,000
career in itself has many

153
00:07:46,001 --> 00:07:48,854
different paths. You could
think of it as all of the different

154
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,362
specializations
that I said before

155
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:54,000
where in game development, you could
either work as a game programmer, a

156
00:07:54,001 --> 00:07:56,000
game designer. And most

157
00:07:56,001 --> 00:07:59,000
importantly, I would say you could
work as an indie game developer. You

158
00:07:59,001 --> 00:08:00,000
don't have to work sitting

159
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:04,000
there nine to five, killing your
eyes, killing your back, killing your

160
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,024
social life. Instead, you

161
00:08:05,502 --> 00:08:09,000
could work from home and develop
games on your own or maybe in small teams.

162
00:08:09,001 --> 00:08:10,000
Technology is getting

163
00:08:10,001 --> 00:08:14,179
so advanced in game development
that this is fully possible. And I think

164
00:08:14,204 --> 00:08:15,544
it's a lot more comfortable.

165
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And lastly, one of the most in demand
fields there are right now is AI and

166
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,000
machine learning development.

167
00:08:23,001 --> 00:08:27,000
Now, I know you've probably seen it
everywhere. How AI is on the rise. And

168
00:08:27,001 --> 00:08:28,000
yeah, AI is getting

169
00:08:28,001 --> 00:08:32,000
incredibly powerful. Just in the last
couple of months, there's been so much

170
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,000
progress and development

171
00:08:34,001 --> 00:08:37,000
in machine learning and AI that honestly,
it really scared me for a bit. But

172
00:08:37,001 --> 00:08:38,000
then I sat back and

173
00:08:38,001 --> 00:08:43,000
realized this isn't the Terminator.
I'll be back. And that's the thing. I

174
00:08:43,001 --> 00:08:44,000
don't think many people

175
00:08:44,001 --> 00:08:49,000
realize that AI is not the supercomputer
that can think on its own. Well,

176
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:55,000
it actually is kind of that, but it's
still just a bunch of code. We're not

177
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,000
at the level yet,

178
00:08:56,001 --> 00:09:01,000
where AI can effectively think on its
own without having some human sitting

179
00:09:01,001 --> 00:09:02,000
there telling it what

180
00:09:02,001 --> 00:09:06,000
it's doing wrong or right. Now, this
is a field that is on the rise, but the

181
00:09:06,001 --> 00:09:07,000
most popular language at

182
00:09:07,001 --> 00:09:12,000
the moment to do AI development and
machine learning in is Python, but you

183
00:09:12,001 --> 00:09:13,615
can use it for variety
of different languages

184
00:09:13,627 --> 00:09:15,000
as well. And I would
say for this, you

185
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:16,000
definitely need a bit of math.

186
00:09:16,001 --> 00:09:19,000
You also have to understand some
more in depth computer science concepts to

187
00:09:19,001 --> 00:09:20,001
understand how to

188
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:24,000
program a neural network, but nothing
code academy in a couple of YouTube

189
00:09:24,001 --> 00:09:25,001
videos cannot teach you.

190
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:29,000
I will be making another video going
more into depth about AI. So subscribe

191
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:30,000
if you are interested

192
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:34,000
in that. And yeah, that's pretty much
some of the main jobs that I've looked

193
00:09:34,001 --> 00:09:35,000
into. I do want to

194
00:09:35,001 --> 00:09:38,000
close this video off by saying one
last thing. And I think this is the most

195
00:09:38,001 --> 00:09:39,001
important life lesson

196
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:43,000
that I have been told. See, when it
comes to finding a job, people get this

197
00:09:43,001 --> 00:09:44,000
misconception that they

198
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:48,000
have to look for their dream job or
the job that they're going to absolutely

199
00:09:48,001 --> 00:09:49,000
love to be in every

200
00:09:49,001 --> 00:09:54,000
single day of the week. And that's
just a bit of naive thinking. I'm not

201
00:09:54,001 --> 00:09:55,000
saying that it's impossible

202
00:09:55,001 --> 00:09:59,000
to find your dream jobs. There is
multiple examples online out there where

203
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,200
people find their dream jobs,

204
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:05,000
but some people just don't really
know right away what their dream job

205
00:10:05,001 --> 00:10:06,000
is, or some people

206
00:10:06,001 --> 00:10:09,000
just want to dabble in a bunch of fields.
And so I feel like instead of

207
00:10:09,001 --> 00:10:10,081
saying that you should find

208
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:15,000
your dream job, you should rather
find a job that you tolerate at the very

209
00:10:15,001 --> 00:10:17,000
least. You see, even in a

210
00:10:17,001 --> 00:10:21,000
dream job, you're going to have bad days.
You're going to have days where

211
00:10:21,001 --> 00:10:22,001
you wish you can just

212
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:26,000
jump out the window. And that's
fine because a job is a job. There's the

213
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:28,000
saying you work to live,

214
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:32,000
not live to work. I'm going to try and
do a bunch of different projects, you

215
00:10:32,001 --> 00:10:33,000
know, and post them on

216
00:10:33,001 --> 00:10:37,000
this channel to basically just get
a feel for what I personally and I'm

217
00:10:37,001 --> 00:10:38,000
interested in. And I highly

218
00:10:38,001 --> 00:10:41,078
encourage you to do the same
thing. Anyway, thank you for watching.

219
00:10:41,344 --> 00:10:44,419
Once again, thank you
so much to all of my new

220
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:47,606
subscribers. And
yeah, see you next time.
